# Handling Timeouts and Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This example showcases how to gracefully handle `TimeoutException` and other exceptions that may occur during asynchronous operations in Dart.  Proper error handling is crucial for building robust and reliable applications.

The `fetchData` function simulates an asynchronous operation that may encounter errors, including timeouts and general exceptions.

**Key Features:**

*   Uses `try-catch` blocks to handle potential errors.
*   Specifically catches `TimeoutException` for time-sensitive operations.
*   Demonstrates how to rethrow exceptions to allow higher levels of the application to handle them.
*   Handles unexpected errors using a generic `catch` block.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code as `bug.dart`.
2.  Run it from your terminal using `dart bug.dart`.
3.  Observe the output, which demonstrates successful execution, timeout handling (uncomment the throw statement in fetchData), and error handling.
